## Introduction
I started my journey with the CS50's Web course as a undergraduate student. It was the first course I took outside the university and made me learn a lot within a very short time. I managed to deliver every previous project within 6 months, from June to December, however I landed my first internship in January (in many ways thanks to the knowledge I achieved with this course) and alongside with the final semesters of my undergraduate course I struggled to finish the final project. Now, more than a year later, here I am with an idea I believe can finally make me finish this course with pride!

The idea for this project is to create a website that centralizes common needs that pet's owners face on a daily basis, such as:

- find a trustworthy place to leave their pet;
- find information about pet's health and what to do in face of a situation;
- schedule a visit to the vet, or trigger an alarm where every
- buy products (food, snacks, clothes, accessories, etc) and have them delivered;

All of these ideas came from the numerous experiences me and my girlfriend faced when raising our dog, our Baby Boy: Nugget.

## Distinctiveness and Complexity

<!--  
It reaches new levels of:
- frontend organization (html, css and js folder structure)
- mobile responsiveness
- ui/ux design - to be more professional (even including js plugins for more dynamism)
- backend organization (views.py as a views folder)
- unit and integration tests
- devops (possible to run with docker to ease the installation process)
-->
